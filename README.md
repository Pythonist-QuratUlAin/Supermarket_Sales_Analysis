# Supermarket_Sales_Analysis

I performed an analysis on the Supermarket Sales dataset to identify the purchasing behaviors of customers. This involved defining relevant metrics, such as total sales and drivers of sales, as well as determining the sources of the highest sales. I thoroughly explored the data and created charts and graphs to visualize any interesting trends and insights discovered.
